# SIMON
Simon is the game I chose to do for the first project.

## Project Description 

My app is called Simon. It's a single player game app for players who want to play Simon online. Players can test their memory in a fun and dynamic online game and play Simon, with the player's level being kept automatically and game results displayed once the player loses. Users will have the option to play again.

## User Stories

#### MVP Goals

- As a player, I want my game to generate different patterns every time the game starts/restarts.
- As a player, I would like to be informed when the game is over due to taking too long/selecting the wrong color.
- As a player, I would like to know which level I am on.
- As a player, I would like the option to play the game with sound or without soud.
- As a player I would like to be able to restart the game after a a loss or whenever.
- As a player, I want the UI to be simple and clear so that I can enjoy the experience of playing the game.\*\*

#### Stretch Goals

- As a player, I would like a moving animation for when I lose the game, so that I feel better about losing.
- As a player, I would like the option to hear an audible sounds to confirm that my pattern selection is correct, or when my selection is wrong, or when I run out of time. 
-As a player, I would like a dark option, or a dark neon option.

## Pseudocode
```js
// 1) Define any variables used to track the state of the game:

//    The computer generated pattern
//    Tracking the clicks of the user
//    The game started (boolean)
//    Timer element
//    Option to turn timer element off (boolean)
//    The audio muted(boolean)
//    A result message - display who won that round

// 2) Define the required constants:
//    There are only 4 color choices a player can make (red, blue, green, and yellow)
//    We'll need a reference to a DOM element to display messages

// 3) Handle a player clicking a button

// 4) Handle generating random selections for the pattern as well as continuing until the player makes a mistake.

// 5) Implement a timing element so that player has a certain amount of time to react to the pattern before losing.

// 6) Render lose message to the player 

```
