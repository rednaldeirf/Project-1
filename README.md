## SIMON
**SIMON** is a memory game. There is a randomly generated sequence of colors that the user is expected to repeat. One new color is added to the sequence as the levels progress. The user must select a color within a short time (if the timer option is on) otherwise they will lose the game and be prompted to start again. Each color corresponds with a specific sound as well and this can also be turned off if the player chooses to have a sound free experience.

## Technologies used:

## Next steps: 
In the future, I would like to:

* Find better sound options;
* Add a *Neon Mode* with laser sounds;
* Make the color sequence more ***distinct***.
